### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. I learned about the HTML BOM and DOM and how they are used to create dynamic changes on a webpage. 
2. I learned that you have to use a createEventListeners() function to listen for whenever the user clicks a button to scroll through pictures on the page    or when the user clicked the "show more images button". Without this function the computer would never know when a user clicked a button.  
3. I learned that you can add additional images by creating a node.
